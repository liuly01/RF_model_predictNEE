The optimal model was chosen through a Random Forest model employing ten-fold cross-validation (experiment1.m and experiment2.m) and subsequently applied to generate global products spanning from 2001 to 2020 (predict_globalNEE.m). The NEE results were then converted to NEP through area calculation (NEE_NEP.m).The code requires Matlab version 2014a or higher.

Using the GEE platform in conjunction with the geemap tool for data pre-processing and site-level extraction and download of code is also available.
